Her place of birth is captured as the United States, precisely at the Medical Center of St. Elizabeth, located in Boston, Massachusetts. This obviously makes the youngster an American by nationality.

So I'm thrilled to introduce you guys to Hazel!!! <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#NoKidsPolicy</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qVvUTRdllP</a></p><p>— John Krasinski (@johnkrasinski) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2014</a></p><p>Nothing much is known about Hazel Krasinski’s academic journey, but her mum told fans on the set of a 2020 edition of Jimmy Kimmel Live! that her children are going to what she described as a “proper school with proper uniforms”. The actress also said they are “sounding quite British.”</p><h3><strong>Who is Hazel Krasinski’s Father?</strong></h3><p>The youngster’s dad has been identified as John Burke Krasinski. Born on the 20th of October 1979, John is the last child of Mary Clare (née Doyle) and Ronald Krasinski. He grew up alongside two brothers and was raised a Catholic.</p><p>John is an alum of Brown University and also attended National Theater Institute to study theatre arts.

He is best known for the situational comedy, The Office on NBC, where he breathed life into the character of Jim Halpert. Hazel Krasinski’s dad functioned as the series producer cum director. John has also appeared in other movies and TV shows.</p><p>Since he became a dad, the actor and movie maker has been ecstatic, and he prides himself as a hands-on father. Talking to PEOPLE in 2016, John said fatherhood altered his life to a great deal; he started experiencing some existential crisis right from the moment Hazel announced her entrance. Krasinski said it was really serious, like having a mirror held up to you with someone watching your every move, and you know that you must lead by example. Becoming a father made John give up some things and concentrate on becoming a better person for the sake of his children.</p><h3><strong>Hazel’s Mum is Also an Actress</strong></h3><p>Just like her dad, Hazel Krasinski’s mum is also part of the entertainment industry as a British actress. Born in London, on February 23rd, 1983, Emily Olivia Laura Blunt is the daughter of Former actress cum teacher, Joanna Blunt, and Oliver Blunt, who works and earns a living as a legal practitioner.

The British actress achieved her breakthrough in 2006, starring in the TV film, Gideon’s Daughter and the comic-drama movie entitled The Devil Wears Prada.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/06/OIP-1-e1685634828937.jpg><h2><strong>Hazel Krasinski has One Sibling Named Violet</strong></h2><p>Hazel is already a big sister to Violet Krasinski, who announced her entrance in 2016.</p><p>Hazel was barely one year when John and Emily announced on Entertainment Tonight that they were ready to give her a sibling. John has been back on Entertainment Tonight after the birth of Violet Krasinski, and according to the actor, Hazel has been such an amazing big sister.</p><p>Just in the same way, he announced Hazel Krasinski’s birth, John also took to Twitter to tell the world that he has become a second-time father.</p><p>Violet wasn’t up to two years when her dad on Ellen DeGeneres Show revealed that the youngster already has an ear for music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/06/R-1-e1685634591302.jpg><h2><strong>Hazel Krasinski was Born After Her Parents Got Married</strong></h2><p>John Krasinski and his wife, Emily Blunt, were already four years into their marriage when Hazel was born.</p><p>The celebrity duo met at a restaurant through a mutual friend, but prior to that, The Office alum was already crushing on Emily after he watched her movie, The Devil Wears Prada. He later confessed to his spouse that he watched the film over 70 times and was glad she chose to remain with her stalker. It was love at first sight for John, who has since admitted that the chemistry was instant and undeniable.</p><p>The couple had their first date at John’s apartment, where they went for a Pizza. John’s rep said they became officially engaged in August 2009, but the details were kept private. However, the American actor said it was such a happy and emotional moment that reduced them to tears.</p><p>A year after their official engagement, Hazel Krasinski’s parents exchanged wedding vows on July 10th, 2010, and the ceremony was hosted in Lake Como, Italy, precisely at George Clooney’s estate. Reports said it was a quiet affair with just family and friends in attendance.</p><p>The couple’s union has endured for almost 13 years and still counting, and from what is perceivable, they may take it as far into the future as possible.</p><h2><strong>Hazel May be Following in her Parent’s Footsteps</strong></h2><p>John Krasinski was on the set of The Ellen DeGeneres Show in February 2020 and revealed that his first daughter loves to crack jokes. He described both his daughters as big jokesters with big hearts. With how Hazel is going, it would not be surprising if she also chooses to forge a career in the entertainment industry like her mum and dad.</p><p>Hazel Krasinki is also turning out to be a philanthropist.
